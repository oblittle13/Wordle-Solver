Basic implementation.

Allows user to play their own wordle game, or watch the "ai" try to solve it.

"ai" currently selects a word at random from possible list (future improvment - create actual intelligence)

target word is currently randomly selected (future improvment - retrieve NYT wordle of the day, but also allow for randomly generated words)
